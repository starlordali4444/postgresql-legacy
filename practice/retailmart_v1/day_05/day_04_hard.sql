   SQL PRACTICE SET — DAY 4 (HARD LEVEL)
   Instructor: Sayyed Siraj Ali
   Topic: Filtering & Sorting (Advanced Conditional Logic)
   Scope:
     - Complex WHERE conditions with nested AND/OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL.
     - Multi-level ORDER BY with ASC/DESC + NULLS control.
     - Advanced filtering using expressions and alias sorting.
     - Only SELECT queries from retailmart schema.
   Structure: 10 Conceptual + 50 Complex Filtering + 40 Advanced Sorting = 100 total
