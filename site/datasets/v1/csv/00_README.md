## 🔍 Validation Queries

### Verify Row Counts

```sql
\c retailmart
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales.orders;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers.customers;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products.products;
```

### Verify Relationships

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, c.full_name, p.prod_name
FROM sales.orders o
JOIN customers.customers c ON o.cust_id = c.cust_id
JOIN products.products p ON p.prod_id < 10
LIMIT 5;
```

### Check Duplicate Constraints

```sql
SELECT store_id, prod_id, COUNT(*)
FROM products.inventory
GROUP BY 1, 2 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
