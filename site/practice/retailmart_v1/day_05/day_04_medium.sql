   SQL PRACTICE SET — DAY 4 (MEDIUM LEVEL)
   Instructor: Sayyed Siraj Ali
   Topic: Filtering & Sorting (Multi-condition Filtering)
   Scope:
     - Clauses: WHERE, AND, OR, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, IS NULL, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, LIMIT
     - Combine multiple clauses in a single query
     - Only SELECT queries from retailmart schema
   Structure: 10 Conceptual + 50 Filtering Queries + 40 Sorting Queries = 100 total
